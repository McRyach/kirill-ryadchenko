                    <p>A discipline is an entry gate into an occupation of 
                        particular complexity. It introduces a conceptual framework

                        environment of cultural participation. An entropy of such 
                        field might seem disruptive, but it is only natural that 
                        the social processes follow the inevitable motion of 
                        cultural life. Instead of static edifice it is more

                        meaning and establish aesthetic experience between an 
                        object and spectator. Whereas authors might have an 
                        intent and a narrative, they can't cover every possible 
                        meaning of an object they created. Spectators are free 
                        to interpret an object and find meaning closest to them.
