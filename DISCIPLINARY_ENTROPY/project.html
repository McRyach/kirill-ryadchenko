            A discipline evloves and changes its course. In a historic 
            perspective it may have week connections with its original role, 
            but it compensate through finding new ones. This trajectory 
            deviates with the social image of the discipline due to its 
            necessary autonomy. When discipline is allowed to enclose itself 
            and receive a budget of credibility from a public. It allows 
            discipline to focus on it's internal problems, increasing 
            organizational complexity, and forming a conceptual theory. 
            Such enclosure allows greater organizational complxity and 
            richness, but requires to proof its credibility before public.
