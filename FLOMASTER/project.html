            There is no title which can encapsulate the complexity of professional 
            agency in a social culture and economic exchange. Whichever title 
            profession bare, it is constantly drifting further away from what 
            it meant previously in the ocean of social exchange. The social 
            exchange is seeking for new activities which wouldn't be satisfied 
            with known occupations. Hence there are esoteric job titles such as 
            evangelist and Jedi. That is a reflection of dynamic structure of 
            social exchange.

            My occupation is not an exception. It is drifting between a cultural 
            agency and technological opportunity. It is floating between Art, 
            Technology, and Economy. Its primary subject is physical matter, 
            and it's the main object is social meaning.

            A real master of such profession understands that the form is 
            determined by it's medium. Systems Engineering gives a useful 
            understanding of the relationship between a form and a medium. 
            To look deeper into the problem one needs to look further away. 
            To understand the details and make sense of their meaning one need 
            to understand the outward structure, which the given problem is a 
            part of. Understanding the limitations of the medium is a great 
            liberation from the anxiety of formal research. Whether the form 
            is a project execution plan, a software code or a sculpture. 
            Each of the forms requires understanding of a medium and therefore 
            limitations and possibilities. Such  fundamental understanding of 
            interdependency between a form and a medium helps to unfetter 
            creativity in a systematic way, switching the vector of a question 
            inward or outward. While looking inward one would master a 
            formal technique. And outward focus would give a fundamental 
            understanding and conceptual research and a mind shift. </p>
