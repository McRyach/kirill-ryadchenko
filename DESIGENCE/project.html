            In the process of creating variation, evaluating the variants of 
            forms and extracting prominent features designer advancing the 
            authority over the cycle. Each cycle of creating, evaluating, 
            extracting performed via given medium. Thus each stage of the 
            cycle can be performed in a variety of mediums.
            <br><br>
            Through selection of medium for each stage and working with it 
            and author exhibit its agency. Unlike evolutionary process, 
            where the destination is unknown, designer project it's 
            authority on the cyclical process and discriminates against 
            iterations in favor of their design PURSUIT. Such PURSUIT 
            constitutes Design Agency. Designer create objects and events 
            that make sense to him in the effort of radiating cultural 
            meaning. Equally Designer reads a cultural phenomenon 
            discriminating in favor of their agency. Such commitment to a 
            topic of PURSUIT makes DESIGENT a medium. Which sees the 
            meaning in a particular topic and generate a variety of 
            objects and events for the society to select and test against 
            reality of social needs.
