        <p>Lace knitting pattern utilize the continuity of a thread forming two 
            dimensional form out of one dimensional medium. Topological code of knots, 
            intersections and loosening provide the difference in material density.</p>
        <img src="Mandrel.jpg" alt="Tool Path Diagrams">
        <p>One of the first iterations of the thread manufacturing. The thread is 
            floated away from the surface building loose support for outer layers. So 
            the floating can be achieved through multiple layer offsetting from the 
            original framework.</p>
        <img src="diagrams.png" alt="Initial Stage">
        <p>Three tool paths with different level of material freedom. Each tool path 
            allow the material to reveal its tectonic pattern.</p>

        <p>Three iterations have different level of material freedom through speed 
            and proximity to the framework.</p>
        <img src="process.png" alt="Iterative Design and Medium Development">
        <p>The diagram shows two main stages of the process. The development stage 
            revealed the tectonic patterns of the fabrication process. And the design 
            stage where the patterns were used as a medium to create a form. The design 
            process then would have necessary amount of iterations. Each iteration is 
            optically captured and modeled to inform new iteration.</p>
        <img src="scan.png" alt="3D Image Scan">
        <p>3D scan capture of the second iteration of the design stage. This scan is 
            used to build a new tool path on top of it</p>

        <p>The result of the second stage of design iteration. Due to the lack of robot 
            lab time our group 3d printed an outer frame instead of building it from the 
            core. However in case of more lab freedom the outer frame should be formed 
            floating the threads of the core of the object.</p>

        <p>Third iteration of the design stage.
