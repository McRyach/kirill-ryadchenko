                Is art illustration of beauty and harmony, revelation of divine will, 
                formal expression of artists sensual experiences or aesthetic 
                experimental research? As in case of many other fields, art redefines 
                its role in culture. In last century art aggressively contested a 
                faith as primary spiritual experience, and coupled with philosophy in 
                a search of deep intellectual meaning. Entering public domain art 
                faced competition from entertainment as the guiding skipper of ideal 
                public model. Art objects supposed to radiate meaning and establish 
                aesthetic experience between and object/event and a 
                spectator/participant. Whereas authors might have the intent and a 
                narrative they can't cover every possible meaning that the 
                object/event create. That freedom to interpret the meaning of art by 
                a spectator/participant creates freedom of finding the meaning to 
                everyone. To facilitate such freedom of reading an art objects tend 
                to become more ambiguous, subtly whispering many stories.
