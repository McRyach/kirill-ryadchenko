            Project: Develop software prototype in Unity 3D utilizing Hololens SDK and Vuforia image tag recognition library 
            <br>
            Role: Coder, Developer, 3d Designer 
            <br><br>
            Video capture from Hololens headset demonstrating the functionality 
            of the prototype.  In real life, Hololens camera should see the 
            image tag to recognize the part. For the demonstration image on the 
            phone screen was used as a substitute for the graphics. The image 
            tag must be in the field of view on Hololens camera to recognize the part.
            <br><br>
            In the practical application of augmented reality on construction 
            site, serious consideration must be given to the interface. The wireframe 
            representation will be more favorable for the consideration of safety and 
            clear sight. Not more than 2% of the vision must be allowed to use with 
            holographic shading. Safety must take priority in using augmented reality 
            headsets on construction site.

            Diagram showing the location and fastening of each part. The most value 
            from using holographic assembly guide could be realized in complex 
            assembly of unique parts that look similar. A viable application would 
            be art and interior installations with many parts where the coordination 
            of the assembly is the main priority and the pain point.

            Assembly parts should have clear image tag identification fro Hololens to recognize the unique part.
