        <p>This project has been developed in two stages. The conceptual 
            one where the problem of physical matter and architectural medium got addressed. 
            And the physical one where the robotic prototype was developed. 
            This project was my SCI-Arc thesis and layer out the professional 
            endeavor of my professional agency.</p>

        <p>Until this medium will become available to experiment in physical reality 
            the speculative forms will only mimic the material we have experience with.</p>
        <img src="Building.jpg" alt="Voxel Mass Architectural Scale">
        <p>The architectural form is intentionally left blank. It has no form until the further development.</p>

        <p>However  it is not hard to imagine the dynamic and choreographic quality of 
            an architectural space loosely formed by the spherical units. </p>

        <p>The most vital way to develop a project focusing on material medium  was to 
            fabricate a prototype unit. The given example is a final iteration. 
            The sphere is subdivided on triangles as dymaxion dome. To enable mounting 
            inside parts sphere has demountable units.</p>
        <img src="Sphere.png" alt="Exploded Drawing of Feromagnetic Shell">
        <p>The shell of the sphere is covered with 2mm steel sheet to have 
            ferromagnetic surface. Holes in the frame is left for round magnets. </p>
        <img src="Main.png" alt="Exploded Drawing of Magnet Lock Assembly">
        <p> Magnets are placed in 4MM ferromagnetic enclosure to turn magnets on and off 
            by a servo motor. A single sphere has 32 controllable magnets. </p>
        <img src="DiagramWhite.png" alt="Assembly Diagramm">
        <p>The geometry of a unit as chosen to provide irregular spatial grid. As for 
            regular spatial grid is know to be more fragile structurally. Sphere packing 
            doesn’t fit tightly however in case where the form consisted of spherical 
            units has to have a tight fit a flexible polymer membrane will seal the 
            space between the spheres. In the current stage I limited the effort to 
            the connection mechanism. 
            <br><br>
            The attraction force is squared to the distance, so the magnets can only 
            secure the position of the unit in place but don’t fit to actuate is. 
            For actuation a rapid stop gyrator shall be used.</p>
