        <p>Two initial behaviors recognize the corner conditions of flat side 
            of the cube and build a tool path melting away the wax cube. 
            As the cube gets more melted it is becoming harder to definitely 
            distinguish a corner and a flat.</p>

            corner of the cube and builds a tool path indicated as a red line. </p>

        <img src="Thomas.jpg" alt="Robot Lab Setup">
        <p>The physical setup includes a wax cube on the turn table which is 
            controlled by Arduino from Processing. Across from the cube is Staubli 
            RX-60 robot arm with the heat gun fixed at the tool tip. Robot arm is 
            getting VAL-3 coordinates from Processing via serial port. Below robot 
            arm Kinect sensor which scans the wax cube in 3D and sends the point 
            cloud to the Processing. The Laptop which runs the processing is not 
            shown.
